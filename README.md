Important archival note:

# DO NOT RUN THIS VERSION

This version is an unpatched release of DSv3.5.1 that lacks a couple of critical patches for SEVERE security vulnerabilities. 

This version is only made available for preservation purposes. If you are interested in running the DragonSlayer Edition in production, you MUST harden the entire code base.

I have previously contacted all remaining public instances running the "DragonSlayer Edition" to inform them of security vulnerabilities I am aware of that exist in this code. To the best of my knowledge they have all been patched, shut down or otherwise secured. I have additonally waited more than a year before creating and publishing this repository.
