# DO NOT RUN THIS VERSION

This version is an unpatched release of DSv3.5.1 that lacks a couple of critical patches for **severe** security vulnerabilities. 

This branch is only made available for archival purposes. If you are interested in running the DragonSlayer Edition in production, please get in touch with the maintainer of this repository.
